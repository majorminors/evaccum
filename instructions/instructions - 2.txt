Thanks so much for volunteering to take part in this!!

If you haven't seen the powerpoint yet, please do that first and then return!

============================
= Step One: initial set up =
============================

Open MATLAB and set MATLAB's present working directory (pwd) to the 
top level directory of the repository (TLD). If you've downloaded the 
zip file and extracted it, the TLD will be called 'evaccum-master'. If
you've cloned the git repo, then it will be whatever you have called it 
*or* if you didn't specify a name, it will be 'evaccum'.

You should be able to see the following:

instructions (directory)
tools_analysis (directory)
tools_exp (directory)
EvAccum_coherence_threshold_test.m (file)
EvAccum_matching_threshold_test.m (file)
EvAccum.m (file)

If it's not possible to set the pwd to the TLD, remember to alter the 
'rootdir' variable under '% initial settings' in each script to reflect 
the full path to the TLD, e.g.:
rootdir = 'path\to\TLD';

Don't forget the quotations around the path.

=================================
= Step Two: running the scripts =
=================================

You will run the scripts in the following order:

1. EvAccum_coherence_threshold_test.m
2. EvAccum_matching_threshold_test.m
3. Evaccum.m

1. Coherence thresholding (EvAccum_coherence_threshold_test.m)
----------------------
The coherence threshold test will establish some personalised thresholds 
that reflect your sensitivity to moving dot stimuli. First you will do
some training to familiarise yourself with the test. The training will 
run until you achieve a certain performance level (less than 5 mins).

- Open the script and look under the '%initial settings' comment (line 54).
- Ensure the 'rootdir' variable is correct (pwd if MATLAB's working directory
is the TLD, or else the full path to the TLD)
- Set the 'p.training_enabled' variable to 1.
- enter the dimensions of your screen and the distance of your screen 
from your face in cm
- run the script.
- enter your participant number in the prompt and click 'ok'
- follow the on screen instructions. During the training you can only press
'a' and 's' in response to the questions, or 'q' if you need to quit. 
Other keys are disabled.
- On completion of training, the experiment will end abruptly and throw an 
error, which should read that training is complete.

After you have finished training, you will do the test proper (about 5 mins).
- Under 'initial settings' set 'p.training_enabled' to 0.
- run the script.
- you will be warned that you are going to overwrite the training file. This
is fine - press 'y' to continue.
- follow the on screen instructions. During the test you can only press
'a' and 's' in response to the questions, or 'q' if you need to quit. 
Other keys are disabled.
- On completion of the test, MATLAB will close all screens, and begin 
running analysis scripts. Eventually a few figures will pop up on the 
screen and you can see your performance on the left plot if you're interested.
x-axis = coherence level (from 0-100%)
y-axis = accuracy (from 50-100%)

As the coherence level increases, so should your accuracy. On the right plot is
your reaction times.
x-axis = coherence level (from 0-100%)
y-axis = reaction time (secs)

As the coherence level increases, your reaction time should decrease.

Close the plots.

You're finished the coherence test!

2. Match thresholding (EvAccum_matching_threshold_test.m)
-------------------
The matching threshold test will establish some personalised thresholds 
that reflect your sensitivity to decision boundaries. First you will do
some training to familiarise yourself with the test. The training will 
run until you achieve a certain performance level (usually no more than
a couple of mins).

- Open the script and look under the '%initial settings' comment (line 64).
- Ensure the 'rootdir' variable is correct (pwd if MATLAB's working directory
is the TLD, or else the full path to the TLD)
- Set the 'p.training_enabled' variable to 1.
- enter the dimensions of your screen and the distance of your screen 
from your face in cm
- run the script.
- enter your participant number in the prompt and click 'ok'
- follow the on screen instructions. During the training you can only press
'a' and 's' in response to the questions, or 'q' if you need to quit. 
Other keys are disabled.
- On completion of training, the experiment will end abruptly and throw an 
error, which should read that training is complete.

After you have finished training, you will do the test proper (about 12 mins).
- Under 'initial settings' set 'p.training_enabled' to 0.
- run the script.
- you will be warned that you are going to overwrite the training file. This
is fine - press 'y' to continue.
- follow the on screen instructions. During the test you can only press
'a' and 's' in response to the questions, or 'q' if you need to quit. 
Other keys are disabled.
- On completion of the test, MATLAB will close all screens, and begin 
running analysis scripts. Eventually a few figures will pop up on the 
screen and you can see your performance. This is the same as the coherence
results, except for two things:

1. there are two sets, one for the low coherence threshold we obtained 
in the previous test, and one for the high coherence threshold
2. the accuracy plot is flipped, so the easier matching is on the left, 
and the harder matching is on the right. As you go from left to right, your
performance should decrease and reaction time increase.

Close the plots.

You're finished the matching test!

3. Experiment (Evaccum.m)
----------
The EvAccum experiment will now use the thresholds we obtained to get some
reaction times. In the experiment, you will only get feedback every now and 
then, and the trials will not end as soon as you press the key. Instead they 
will go on for a fixed interval. This will take about 40 mins.

- Open the script and look under the '%initial settings' comment (line 64).
- Ensure the 'rootdir' variable is correct (pwd if MATLAB's working directory
is the TLD, or else the full path to the TLD)
- enter the dimensions of your screen and the distance of your screen 
from your face in cm
- run the script.
- enter your participant number in the prompt and click 'ok'
- follow the on screen instructions. During the training you can only press
'a' and 's' in response to the questions, or 'q' if you need to quit. 
Other keys are disabled.
- On completion the screens will close themselves. Almost done!

===========================================
= Step Three: check and send me the data! =
===========================================

Please now go into TLD>data and check the following 9 outputs exist:
Consider that 'xx' reflects your participant number, 
e.g. participant 3 would be 'S03'.

- Sxx_EvAccum.mat
- Sxx_EvAccum_coherence_threshold_test.mat
- Sxx_EvAccum_coherence_threshold_test_rts.fig
- Sxx_EvAccum_coherence_threshold_test_sigmoid.fig
- Sxx_EvAccum_matching_threshold_test.mat
- Sxx_EvAccum_matching_threshold_test_high_coh_rts.fig
- Sxx_EvAccum_matching_threshold_test_highcohsigmoid.fig
- Sxx_EvAccum_matching_threshold_test_low_coh_rts.fig
- Sxx_EvAccum_matching_threshold_test_lowcohsigmoid.fig

If any of these do not exist, please let me know. Something has gone wrong!

Once you have these files, please send them back to me:

dorian.minors@mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk

It's probably best to zip them into an archive first, because sometimes 
outlook will strip them from the email thinking they're malicious files.

Thanks again!!
