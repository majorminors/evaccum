Testing reqs.
-------------
- test new triggers are working
- test that d.resp_keycode works as expected (i.e. records a code for the key pressed)
- test that d.blocks_completed works as expected (i.e. records the actual number of blocks completed)

LBA:
----
- familiarise yourself with what you did - https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/wiki/BMS-for-group-studies/
- plot winning model and model that wins when winning model removed
- plot B  between conditions
- plot t0 for subjects (between 200-600ms) - find a ref for this
- do some stats?
 - Jasper
 - rm anova
 - bayesian?


General Improvements
====================

Exp script edits
-----------------


Analysis script edits
----------------------
- LBA - plotting (and saving output)
	- consider saving data2fit or else running the plotting after the function
- LBA - run and select model scripts

- update to use actual number of blocks completed (d.blocks_completed) instead of 'block'
- update to reflect new MEG trigger values
- LBA update to use response key code (d.resp_keycode) which records actual key pressed rather than coding it directly in a_dataprep


Pilot data
==========
S03
---
- in run 4 MEG triggers seem to default to 255. might be able to recover from button press to start sub-block of 8 (since we should be able to time the coherence onset from the button press trigger)

- in run 3, the last rt is cut off, so will add in script to make the MEG rt the computer measured rt
	- wonder if I can automate this
