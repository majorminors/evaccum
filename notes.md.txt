General Improvements
====================
- change triggers - just 1 for coherence onset, then code from that. Possibly have 1 for trial onset, and another 1 for coherence onset.
- add something to the script to tell the data output file how many blocks we actually completed (rather than p.num_blocks being how many blocks we planned to do)

Pilot data

- in run 4 MEG triggers seem to default to 255. might be able to recover from button press to start sub-block of 8 (since we should be able to time the coherence onset from the button press trigger)

- in run 3, the last rt is cut off, so will add in script to make the MEG rt the computer measured rt
	- wonder if I can automate this
