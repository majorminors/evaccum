After splitting:
conditions in funFitBehav 
- (line 55)
- line 91
	- fiterror_cell
	- data2fit 1:2 = 1:4

- preprocessing:
	- work through powerstuff
	- work through decoding

wlts on why this is different

Backgound
---------
- baysian information criterion penalises heavily addition of parameters that don't add anything
	- not that their criteria are zero, but that it's not as high. If we plotted the BIC it would be scattered.
- no way to bias: so start bias doesn't make sense
- decision boundary alterations reflect accumulation of more evidence - it's a measure of difficulty
	- could be related to the speed accuracy trade off - boundary and power (Frank?)


Testing reqs.
-------------
- test new triggers are working
- test that d.blocks_completed works as expected (i.e. records the actual number of blocks completed)

LBA:
----
- get model frequencies thing from plot
- familiarise yourself with what you did - https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/wiki/BMS-for-group-studies/
- consolidate datasummaries
- t0 for subjects should be between 200-600ms - find a ref for this
- do some stats?
 - rm anova


General Improvements
====================

Exp script edits
-----------------


Analysis script edits
----------------------
- LBA - plotting (and saving output)
	- consider saving data2fit or else running the plotting after the function
- LBA - selecting model
	- pull design-space out automatically for reading later (maybe put in settings)

- update to use actual number of blocks completed (d.blocks_completed) instead of 'block'
- update to reflect new MEG trigger values
- LBA update to use response key code (d.resp_keycode) which records actual key pressed rather than coding it directly in a_dataprep


Pilot data
==========
S03
---
- in run 4 MEG triggers seem to default to 255. might be able to recover from button press to start sub-block of 8 (since we should be able to time the coherence onset from the button press trigger)

- in run 3, the last rt is cut off, so will add in script to make the MEG rt the computer measured rt
	- wonder if I can automate this
