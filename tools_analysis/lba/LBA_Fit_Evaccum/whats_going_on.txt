So we start in:

run_fitbehav_PD
change the paths for everything, and pull the data from the place we want (sample IDs)
we need the updates scheduler code from Ale, although for testing it won't matter, because we'll debug locally.
create the jobs, then have a switch to test locally, or on the scheduler (running fun_fitbehav instead of the bash script at the bottom).

fun_fitbehav_LBA_PD
you don't need to worry about references to locstim. Maybe remove?

getModelParam_cell_RDK
fitparams_refine_template_RDK
firerror_cell_RDK (which gets the error and BIC from each condition and then combines it to a global BIC for the model to optimise)
